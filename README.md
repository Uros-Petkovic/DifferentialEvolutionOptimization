# DifferentialEvolutionOptimization

This project is optimization of n-dimensional polinom, actually finding optimal coefficients in polinom so the criterium function has it's minimum.

The algorithm that is implemented is Differential Evolution.

Dataset for this project you can see [here](https://github.com/Uros-Petkovic/DifferentialEvolutionOptimization/blob/main/training_300_G.txt).

Python file project you can see [here](https://github.com/Uros-Petkovic/DifferentialEvolutionOptimization/blob/main/DifferentialEvolutionOptimization.py).
